This repository demonstrates a subtle but problematic error-handling pattern in VBScript. The `GetValue` function uses `On Error Resume Next` to suppress errors during value setting.  While seemingly harmless, the subsequent `Err.Clear` prevents proper propagation of errors.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and makes debugging difficult because the root cause of the failure is obscured. The solution shows how to improve error handling by checking the error object *before* clearing it and providing more informative error messages.
